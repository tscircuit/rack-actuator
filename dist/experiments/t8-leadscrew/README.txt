Width variant: 1x. Output plate: 42 x 42 mm. Base width: 80 mm. Upper bearing span: 41.569 mm.

# T8×8 × 100 mm screw — adjustable six-bearing actuator

Sized around a standard 100 mm overall T8×8 rod, including the portion inside the coupling. This provides 70 mm usable output extension (8.75 revolutions). Two stationary triangles of three 625ZZ bearings guide a chamfered hollow carriage. Bearing stations are 93 and 133 mm (40 mm apart). Both lower bearings are supported on one side by one shared rigid printed carrier with two side rails and cross-braces. There are no flexures or external motor/screw support bearings.

## Bearing adjustment

Four M5×25 adjustment bolts enter from above, bear on washers and fixed shelves, and engage four M5 heat-set inserts in the shared carrier. The rear row is X=81 mm and the front row is the front bearing station minus 12 mm. Y=±26 mm at 1×, ±47 mm at 2× and ±89 mm at 4×. Tighten evenly to take up the 1 mm adjustment range. Preload force and carrier tilt are not simulated.

Use four ruthex RX-M5x9.5 inserts (Ø7.1 mm × 9.5 mm). Printed seats have Ø6.4 mm pilots, 10.5 mm depth, a tapered entry and a through passage for the bolt. At least 2.6 mm radial material is retained around the seat. See the [manufacturer’s dimension sheet](https://www.igo3d.com/mediafiles/Sonstiges/Ruthex/ruthex_Datenblatt_RX-Serie.pdf). Heat-set the inserts into the loose carrier before installing bearings and assembling it. The assembly viewer represents displaced plastic around the seated insert; the STL retains the smaller pilot. Inserts stay bonded to the carrier during adjustment and explosion. Test installation on the actual print; heating and pull-out strength are not simulated.

The carrier slides in one base channel and withdraws through the exit. Integral split PETG axles retain the bearings. Lid bolts and external receiving holes retain their existing three-ridge seats; outer base mounts remain plain M5 clearance through-holes. Motor bolts enter the motor’s metal threads.

## Bearing-face relief

All six bearing supports have an integral Ø7.4 mm inner-race land. A Ø17 mm relief around each land recesses the surrounding face by 2 mm relative to the bearing face, keeping the outer ring and shield clear. No bearing axle bolts, washers or loose support spacers are needed. The full bearing insertion corridor is relieved to remove the former thin plastic lip above each bearing.

The land diameter is a prototype choice within the 7.4–8.3 mm shaft-abutment range in the [SKF 625-Z drawing](https://assets.alliedelec.com/v1644492269/Datasheets/c5ad7fad1c9a5f6a3c382f0ca640fe6a.pdf). Confirm the inner-race face width on the purchased bearing and remove print burrs before assembly. Validation checks the land material and the surrounding clearance on both bearing faces against every printed part.

## Integral PETG snap axles

All bearing axles are connected to their printed supports. Each has a nominal Ø4.8 mm shaft, two Ø6.4 mm retaining ears with a Ø4.6 mm tapered lead-in, and a tapered relief slot (2.2 mm at the tip, 2.0 mm at the head, 1.2 mm at the root) with a 0.6 mm rounded end. The straight journal extends 1.25 mm beyond the bearing face before the exposed tip bends 30° toward the carriage. The free end is 3 mm longer than revision 14. Its widest, Ø6.4 mm retaining shoulder is 0.25 mm beyond the bearing face. A 0.55 mm shoulder band leads into a long taper that narrows to Ø4.6 mm at the bent tip. The bearing bears against the flat shoulder if it starts to slide off. The ears are narrow across the slot so squeezing the prongs inward lets the entire head pass through the Ø5 mm bore. The slot and clearance extend behind the bearing seat to provide bending length while the fixed annular land supports the inner race.

The exploded view straightens the bent tip and compresses the prongs by 0.85 mm at the retaining shoulder, slides the bearing 12 mm along its axle, then releases the tip. Validation checks that the widest head section is at the bearing-facing shoulder, that the uncompressed shoulder retains the bearing after 0.25 mm of axial clearance, and that the compressed head passes the bore. This is a geometric shear illustration, not an elastic analysis or PETG material qualification. Print the support and carrier with the axial relief slot clear; inspect and deburr before fitting. Test the snap fit with your PETG, layer orientation and actual bearing. Avoid forcing a bearing over an oversized print; excessive insertion force or layer separation calls for tolerance adjustment. No load, fatigue or creep rating is claimed.

## Structural lid

The 4 mm lid sits at Z=64–68 mm, within the original motor plate's 68 mm height. Short flanges beside the motor replace the tall posts. Six M3×12 button-head bolts clamp the lid to 12 mm-deep three-ridge base pilots; their heads are recessed below Z=68 mm. Lid bolt pass-throughs and head recesses remain clearance features so the bolts can clamp the lid to the threaded base. The four carrier-adjustment bolts remain reachable through Ø6 mm driver holes. The original floor mounting wells remain accessible through edge reliefs in the lid.

The four outer base mounting holes are plain Ø5.5 mm through-holes for M5 bolts, without self-threading ridges. Their raised pads are 10 mm thick, with clear access from above. The four lid mounts and six mounts on each side retain blind M5 three-ridge self-forming pilots, 9 mm deep. The output face retains its four M3 three-ridge pilots. Local bosses extend inward or upward into existing free space; overall length, width and height do not increase. Limit screw penetration into the blind M5 pilots to 8.4 mm so the screw does not bottom out. External attachment screws are not included in the model; choose their length for the attached structure. The outer base bolts fasten into the supporting structure or use nuts beneath it; the blind receiving pilots need no nuts or inserts.

The large horizontal lower-bearing access holes and the cutouts in the shared carrier's opposite rail are closed. Bearings are installed from inside with the lid and carriage removed, using the existing snap-on assembly sequence. The lid is translucent by default in the viewer; use Show lid or Transparent lid to inspect it.

## Dimensions and mounting

NEMA17 42×42×40 mm motor; 31×31 mm bolt pattern. Carriage guide inradius 16 mm, with 12 mm radial corner chamfers. Output face at X=151 mm when retracted, exactly 70 mm beyond the base at full extension. Carriage tail X=10 mm at home; 4 mm tapered entry. Base 159×80 mm; overall retracted length 191 mm including motor.

Four plain Ø5.5 mm through-holes accept M5 base bolts from above through 10 mm-high local pads. Open Ø12 mm wells leave room for Ø10 mm washers and an Ø11 mm driver. Output flange remains 42×42×8 mm with four M3 three-ridge pilots on 31×31 mm centers; maximum output screw entry 8 mm.

## T8 drive

T8×8 rod, Ø8×100 mm at X=26–126 mm; rigid Ø19×25 mm 5-to-8 mm coupling. The purchased brass flange nut bolts to the carriage bulkhead with four M3×12 screws in three-ridge pilots. The screw axis passes through the center of both bearing triangles. The motor/coupling carries screw thrust; no external shaft bearings are fitted. Hardware meshes are reference envelopes, not manufacturing threads.

## Assembly and files

Use the exploded assembly slider to inspect lid removal, snap-bearing removal and the shared carrier. Extend the carriage to reach the motor bolts. Base mounting and all four carrier adjustment bolts are reached from above. Printed screw versions require screwing the carriage onto the helix; the exploded path rotates the screw during withdrawal. With the carriage removed, straighten the extended tips and pinch the split heads, then slide the bearings along their axles. After adjustment-fastener removal, lift the carrier clear of the raised floor mounting pads and slide it out through the exit. The drive remains a subassembly in the exploded view.

All printable parts are in the STL bundle. Source rebuild: install `python -m pip install -r experiments/t8-leadscrew/requirements.txt`, then run `python experiments/t8-leadscrew/model.py --check --screw-length 100`. Keep the extracted `experiments` directory structure; the printed variant shares the T8 generator and validator. `--quick` creates an unvalidated preview only.

This is a geometry prototype, not a load/stiffness/fatigue rating. The six bearing contacts restore two-station guidance; the print material, bearing preload and unsupported screw still require testing. Three-ridge pilots are prototype values, not preformed helical machine threads.

## Track retention revision

Two 4 × 4 mm longitudinal rails flank each bearing track, with 4 mm entrance ramps. The 1× lower lane accommodates the staggered bearing centers. Matching clearance channels in the supports preserve the 70 mm travel. Withdraw the carriage before releasing the bearings.

The bearing journal has zero bias and remains coaxial with the bearing. Only the extended tip bends, beginning 1.25 mm beyond the bearing face and reaching 30° toward the carriage. Bearings remain square on the running flats. The widest retaining shoulders sit at the bearing-facing edges and are 0.55 mm thick; tapered relief slots retain the original root thickness. This geometry is intended to improve retention; PETG fit, load performance and fatigue need a physical test.

## Screw-length sizing

100 mm names the purchased rod length, not actuator travel. The rod occupies X=26–126 mm, with 8 mm inside the coupling. The 15 mm-long nut occupies X=36.5–51.5 mm at home and X=106.5–121.5 mm at full extension, retaining full engagement and 4.5 mm of screw beyond its front face. The screw tip stays 25 mm inside the output face when retracted. The base is 159 × 80 mm; total retracted length including the motor is 191 mm, or 261 mm fully extended. Both bearing stations move forward to preserve their complete running flats throughout 70 mm travel; spacing remains 40 mm.
